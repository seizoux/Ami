Oh shit, I guess we're starting
The mic is where my heart is
I know what my part is
I hear my own voice
I make my own choice
I guess, we're fuckin' doing it
The horse is out the gates
It's time to start the race
Shoutout to Kathy Bates and also Betty White
All the people, if you're the type
I wanna say that you're equal on the mic
But nobody's equal to me
Nobody is coming for my neck
I am looking for respect
I'm not looking for a check
Unless it is for my friends
That's why we're doing this
To make some pennies
And maybe make amends
Sailors in the sea might get the bends
That is my fuckin' dream
To go with James Cameron in a submarine
To the bottom of the ocean
Rocking forth with the motion
Me and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion
Sharing our emotion
Daring you to fuck with us
At the sea, at a deep water vent
But we don't got the bends, we're not bent
I think that's what I'm meant to do
Me and my crew
Gigantic, looking to cross the sea
For the Titanic
Oh shit, you mean they found it?
Already? They'd abounded with treasure?
Man, that doesn't give me pleasure
I don't know how to measure
How I feel about that shit
But that won't make me quit
In my quest, to scour the deep sea
Like, you and me?
Searching for an angle, mangled
The corpse in the Bermuda Triangle
Maybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane
We're like "oh, shit, what remains"
And
Then we get to the bottom
Amelia Earhart's like "oh, shit, got em!"
You didn't know, but I was an immortal
I just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal
Shuffled off my fucking mortal coil
Mortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil
All my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal
And you know, I am not gonna take a foil
To my head in a little tin cap shape
Because you know I'm great
I popped the grape
But I'm not on some conspiracies
I'm just trying to see what's up in the seas
I believe that I will not cease and desist
You cannot resist
When I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist
I am in Manila, in Hong Kong
In San Francisco, doing a disco
Pop it hot like it's Crisco
But I gotta pace myself
If we're gonna raise this wealth
That's why I flow at this tempo
Hello, I do kempo
In my mind, that's a form of martial arts
But I take, partial starts
And I just gave little partial farts
When I'm shitting on the mic
'Cause you know I got this heart
And you know I got the K-Mart
State-of-the-art mind
But I'm not be-hind
No, I'm way out in the front
Rolling up a 30-foot blunt
And you know I'm not gonna bunt
In a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger
Because I am the rap ringer
I never make the wrong call
And you know, chicks dig the long ball!
I am like (Ah)
They are like (Wow)
Watsky, you cannot stop me
I got no paparazzi
I'm a fucking doorstep
I'm gonna take one more step
And then, take another
Word, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'
Here I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada
Just keep rappin', yada yada yada
Hey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld
Me and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld
Or maybe it's more like Larry David
Because you know we're not playing
Shoutout to the Jews, the chosen people
You know that you cannot fuckin' lose
But also, shoutout to the Christians
Shoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions
You know you cannot stop it
Also, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith
Who know we're gonna make way
For the Jehovah's Witnesses
They got their hit list-esses
Walking up to the different fuckin' doors
Saying "Would you like to love God a little more?"
But it kinda sucks, just because of COVID
They can't be making no bids
I heard they're not doing that door-knockin'
But, you know, we're not stoppin'
However you appraise 'em
No, we are fuckin' raising
On the mic I'm fuckin' blazing
If the sun is blazing
I turn into a raisin
I'm bringing this whole craze
For almost two whole days
I don't think that's possible
I don't think that's wise
I don't think that's probable
That is what they say when they look in to my eyes
My momma was afraid for me
She busted in like the maître d
She said "Hello umm"
I don't think you wanna sit here
I don't think you wanna get here
'Cause you might die
You know but then I was like "I gotta try"
I gotta try to do the right thing
Shoutout to Spike Lee
I'm gonna try to get the ring
Try to get the bling
Try to be the king of the long raps
Like I was the dude with the ass raps
Doesn't matter
As long as the people fuckin' clap
As long as we give a little joy
Give em dat'
Then I will cut the crap
I guess I am a believer
And I don't care that I got seizures
I got my fuckin' pills
I'm gonna take 'em right around midnight
So I can get right
I think that's what I gotta do
Shout out to the medical commun-
Itty I just get gritty
I hope my rhymes are not shitty
Umm, mic check are you with me?
Shout-out Bobby and Whitney
But not shout out to the bad things he did
I don't know if I'm gonna have a kid
I don't know if I'm gonna raise a child
But it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild
They would make be fuckin' smile
They got fuckin' bile and some guts
Everybody does
Everybody got guts
Everybody got nuts
Or half the people maybe like 48.7%
That's about how it went
I think that is the percentage-ish
Of the gender fuckin' separation
Although we know in this nation
Things are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient
If you don't understand
I got my fuckin' rhymes on demand
I can run it back
But I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness
If I'm trying to fuckin' win this
I will not get winded, I have not rescinded
Anything that I've fucking said
By the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead
I'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds
That is like Right Said Fred
You just gotta relax
If you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe
I don't get lyrical cataracts
So I can see clearly, so I can be dearly
Received, I've got to achieve
Whatever I've got up my sleeve
Whatever I've got in my pouch
Shoutout to pouch, ouch
I pricked my finger, that is not true
But on this mic I will linger for you
And for my crew
This is what I've got to do
I've got to drop it hot for you
'Cause this is why I'm hot
This is why I'm not
Shoutout to Mims
Shoutout to Hims
That's that brand of underwear
That I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway
I'm drivin' down the one way
I'm cruisin' up the runway
Spreading my wings
Like I am a Cessna
Like I am a chestnut
Roastin' on an open fire, bing!
Crosby, you got me
Me, hot see?
Me Watsky
See?
Sittin' in the hot seat
No, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat
But that word, beats droppin' me
And meha coppin'
Shoutout to Frank Macoppin
Playground
In the fuckin' San Francisco SFC
Because you know how this go
We are the best in Dolores Park
We have a chorus singin' in the dark
Hark, the angel
Shoutout to Chuck Rangel
Rangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but
In December maybe I will be dismembered
By a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa
Comin' down my chimney
Wavin' fuckin' butcher knives
That’d be fucking crazy
Who is he
Who is this robotic crazy Santa
Oh my ‘lanta
I can’t believe that he’s tryna get me
Instead of giving me presents
I can't believe that he got me on the ground
But I'm like "no I'm Watsky"
And Santa said "oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude"
But I'm like "that's rude
Santa you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'
Plus I was in the nude
He got me tackled on the ground
My fuckin' whole brood around me
And I got my whole butt out
He's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away
Cut-out
Cut it out like on Full House
John Stamos
John Stains-Most in his pants
But that's okay
We don't judge people who like to dance away the day
If they need a Pepto-Bismol
My throat is not abysmal
This all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt
I will not repent
And I’m not demented
But I meant it
When I sent it
From my brain
I'm not plain
Im not fuckin' around
I’m not cluckin' the ground
Just right there it’s only two feet
That’s pretty cool man I eat
From that cup right there
The one that’s floatin' up in the air
It’s got a fuckin' strawber-
-ry smoothie
I flow very smoothly
But you cannot do me
Do me, do me like that
I got that roomie type rap
It’s mad philosophical
I just keep on droppin' all
Of the marbles in my brain
They’re comin' out my nose
And then they just remain
On the ground
Even the cat’s eye
That is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by
Did you know at places
People on the internet watch marble races
I watched one
It was mad fun
I picked the fuckin' blue marble
And my pick wasn't all garbled
It came down the shoot
It was going all fuckin' cool
And then it fuckin scooted past the red one
That kid from The Shining like Red-Rum
Meaning murder
Worder
Wordier
All my flows are so dirtier
Than you could even fuckin' guess
I'm not even fucking stressed
I'm so damn relaxy
Shout out to a Maxi-Pad
For being so absorbent
That's a good fuckin' fuction
My girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it
Put her hands in the air
Maxi Pads doing what they do down there
If you are shaved or if you've got hair
It doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare
Do what you wanna
Word to your mama
Your dude can't tell you what you gotta do
Gotta do what you wanna
Make your own choice
With your body or your voice
If you are moist
I know some people don't like that word
Palabra
But you know you gotta like what you like
There was this one time this dude named Ike
Ran to be Prez
And he fuckin' won
Eisenhower, that's what I said
I's a power-rapper
Yes I am
So fuckin' dapper
The clapper
Doesn't work on the lights on this green screen
Man, that would be a dream scene
If I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want
What I want, damn
That would be no scam
I don't eat no Spam
That's 'cause I am a soft boy
And I only eat Bok-Choy
'Cause I'm a little veggie human
And that's what I be doin'
Let me clarify
Like clarified butter
Again, word to your mother
And also not to digress
But I gotta get it off of my chest
Word to Mark Wahlberg
Word to ballers
Wait, okay, let me make my main point
As I rap over this joint
And that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy
I also eat soy
I also as a Jewish type dude not a goy
Get lots of joy out of eatin' carrots
Out of eatin' broccoli
Out of eatin' lots of trees
Out of smokin' lots of trees
That is true
That is not
I don't smoke a lot
But I do when I party
But during COVID, I party hardly
And I guess that's kinda sad
But I've had some calls with my dad
Paul Watsky
And Claire Watsky
It's rare, stop me
It's not, lots of Sundays
I call my parentals
And I just steal out my fuckin' mentals
But I don't pull out my dentals
I go sometimes I do in a dream
When I am on the scene
And the ghost come and make me scream
It's like you are doing the most
And I gotta fuckin' boast
Shout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast
That is some shit if you take a gander
That was said by Mr. Ned Flanders
Mr. Homer Simpson
I'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on
They're like “Watsky, I'll do everything for you
I'll white knight for you and your fucking crew”
I'm like “Dude, don't be a simp
Actually, DO be a simp
You could be pimp
You could be wimp
You could fucking walk with a limp
You can have a crimp in your dimp-le”
I just get the whole tent pole
Up in the sky cause I meant
Lots of people can come in
Cause I got a big tent
So if you are a lame
Fucking get bent
And by lame, what I mean in this game
Is the type of person who says that you're lame
Is the type of person who judges
Is the type of person who never budges
When they get stubborn
Cause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard
[?] 00:18:04
Word!
I think I got this whole thing turn-ed up
But that is bound to happen
34 hours when you keep on rappin'
Some words are going to collide like trains
Coming head to head, but it remains
To be seen that I get back on the track
With the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*
With my fucking clapping gums
So don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb
Sometimes
Cause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes
But it happens and I think that is the lesson
That you cannot achieve perfection
And it's not even a worthy goal
You just gotta try to put that ball in the hole
More times than not
This is why I'm hot, as I said
But, you know Man's Not Hot?
Although the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am
'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham
On the microphone-o oh no
Can't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno
Ice skatin' all over the beat
Makin' it repeat
I do not want to beat my meat, on the camera
That would be a bad fuckin' PR move
When I'm all up in the groove with my meat out
They would be like "oh, shout out
That will ruin my career
Is that fuckin' clear?
Showin' his whole rear?
He got fuckin' nakey
Make me, take me
You cannot bake me
In my EZ bake oven
No Sara Lee
I just keep on flowing, so merrily
Verily, forsooth, did he do that shit
Oh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it
He's just Frank Coppin it
And there is no halting' it
I just put some fuckin malt in it
Make it like some Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo!
Did you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed
'Cause you could not rhyme
Like I do, do the crime and you know that I'm
Just puttin' lime on top of this shit
And that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me
'Cause you know when I put it on top
That I am going to make it drop
To the bottom of the urinal
You're all in my brain
And I'm hearing y'all
But I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments
I be too scared to see the tools
But I got to just remain bold
And I've got to stay in the hold
My whole nuts life, oh, my nuts
Remember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?
Remember jungle?
They got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate
Verbally, vocally, stoking the fire
Of the couress I retired
I feel one year
'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear
See how I could sing, that took many years
Before I try to do with the din
And now I only rapped
And now I only try to cap, no cap
I just try to get that back
That back, uh, back
And I'm gone
Over the fence
No shout out to my pens
You know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda
I'm sittin' on the veranda
Just sippin' on my water
Lookin' at my ink blotter
Feelin' like the best
Starin' at my Rorschach test
And it's tellin' me some dark crap
It's tellin' some star type of stuff
Like oh shit, I'm gruff
I'm like Scruff, Scruff, Scruff, my gruff
Scruff, my gruff, Chicago, Illinois
6-0-6-5-2 that I'm(00:44:22)
You know that a bat kills
Using sonar
Going through the cave
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
In the sense of my evil
I'm like Evel Knievel
I can jump over three mics
With my tiny little bike
I am gettin' funky
Did you see that video yesterday with the monkey
On the motorbike
That pulled that kid down the street, yeah that little tike
It was really scary
I didn't eat for like three hours, you dared me
To, but I said that that video was too weird
A monkey trying to steal a kid, man, this dude's clear-ly
A weird type of simian
Type of chimpanzee, I don't know which one
It was, it was in Jakarta, I think?
I don't know what type of the rink
Of this world that I skate
I repeat that I'm late
To the party
But that means that partly I gotta go hardy
Hardly, not like Tom Hardy
I don't like smartiesThis is a smoothie by the way, I'm hardly
Eating nothing, I say
I say, good sir
Would you like to duel?
I'll trade you a mule
I'll trade you a tool
I'm going to school
Going to university
Facing adversity
You're seein' the worst in me
I am not burstin' the
Seams, like memes
I'm eating ice creams
I'm chasing my dreams
I'm just tryna seem like a normal dude
But I'm not chilly like Hormal, rude
I am in the can
You know it is not a stamp
What we're doing is real, no fake news
I cannot make you
I cannot take you
Being so far away
I just plant the seed like a caraway
Like a fucking sesame
I want to give you more besame's
More besame
You though?
Besame mucho, when this is all over
(00:46:52)(00:48:16)
Space Jam 2, fucking Pawnstars
(00:48:19)
What do you feel
Man, will it get real?
(00:50:53)
Squidward you had one job
Flipping them burger patties
Rollin' those damn fatties
I wonder what you think
If you try to blink
Man you can just imagine
That you were underground with an fat one
I mean under the ocean rollin' up
Tryin' to light a blunt in the ocean
I don't think that it would light, what emotion
Do you think if you think of Spongebob
Rollin' up under the ground in a pineapple
Under the sea, that is quite snapple [?] of me
To tell you exactly, you see?
I smell you, I feel you, E-40
Would say that to me if it was not so portly
If he was not better
Oh shit, I accidentally insulted E-40
And I was not on purpose
Lord, forgive me, I did not mean this to do this
It just came out of my mouth then it felt the rudest
Even though he's a hero compared to Ham Amazero
I am like Chalamet to De Niro
Dinero, oh shit, shout out to the kid Nero
And Deezus, they are like verbally Jesus
With lots of great writing, Josh fuckin' Gondol, man
Writing that shit, man, you know he's beyond the man
Remember that movie Joanna, man?
I don't think that it was very good
I think that it was sorta weak
But you know that a type of wood is cherry or tea
And yes, I can speak, I'm a freak
Of the week and my beak
Just keeps flappin' and I keep rappin'
I wonder when the beat change will happen
What I keep snappin'
My fingers, I linger
I bring her a pain
I bring this game
To a whole new level
I use a tool like a bevel
Holla without, I am not a devil
I am not a bowl evil
Shout out to all people
All creative people
But not all have the same struggle
You know life's a thugga
War, some people got more
And that is the weird shit
The way that we're living
We don't wanna give in
To the system we were born in
And I hate to horn in
With my own damn opinions
But I don't think rackin' pinions
Steering is the best, man, I'm clearin' out my chest
Now I gotta give you what I think
I don't think you should wear mink
But I think everybody should wear pink
I think everybody should stay hydrated and take a drink
I think that fucking Joel Santana
Cameron were ahead of their time
Damn, thinking purple

Six ones so I can have big fun
I'm gonna ball on the wall
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
I'm a fan
And you all know
And you all go at your own damn speed
It's kinda odd
That I'm flowing the dude who loves all this poetery
Not odd
But his name is girad
Whatever he has I'm sure it's a great bod
And up on the scene in between
I wanna shout out sierra steen
And be so adroit
To remember to shout out alex niece from detroit
A type of weed is harissa or is that a type of spice
Either way I wanna shout out Alyssa and she's really nice
Coughs

I keep on flowin hotter
Hide your wives and your daughters
That’s an og meme man
Inkblotter
I can say a whole mouthful

And I gotta give a shout out to ali
And I'm like goddamn
I give a shoul out to autograph man
And like I gave a shout out to
I just wanna amble
Over to there I don't take a gamble
These are the rarest rhymes I ever spit
This is the rarest three I ever hit
From the middle of the court
Driving down the court in jorts
Oh shit, don't tell Guinness
'Cause I really wanna win-ness
And I really wanna go the distance
All the way to the finish
Shout out to Norwegians and the Finnish
Shout out to dudes who are skittish
And also fucking prudish
I just have a new dish
That I eat everyday for my supper
Shout out to I'm like a guppy
Swimming around in his tank
Not a puppy
You cannot stop me
But you see that Watsky has got what it takes
To not pump the brakes
He is not gonna ever
Sever the ties that he's got
He's no Severus Snape
The cleverest ape on the mic
And you know that he likes
And you know that he loves
To do what he can
He's no toucan sam
He leads with his nose but he gives no damn
And he is goin' ham
He has got the slam
Weed, I see that
Fuckin' Jeff has got the vinyls
'Cause I was runnin' out of shit to this, say
Time to get some things to feed my brain
Now he's got the fuckin' vinyls and they will remain on the table
I think I have got to take a little piss break
Shout out to Mugatu from Zoolander
The hammer falls more American I am not needy
My mind's not the bearest

Shoutin' out Symphony Number 9 in E Minor
Open 64
I just do my thing, I just am the shit
Shout out to John Chenner's greatest tits
How do you say his name? I don't really know
I'm just tryin' to grow a little more every day
Great tunes, great flows, no rooms
You know I'm ruthless
This is the family library of great music
I keep flowin'
In part because I am inspired by Beethoven
Hello, Nash
That's what Jeff says, man, I got no That would be bad, man, I'd fall
Just scratchin' myself, man, but now I stall
I'm talkin' no jive
Just shoutin' out Pablo live
Mary Loo Williams

A taxidermied Iguana XD
This is the coolest gift that I have ever gotten

Now I'm just walking as you hear me talking

If I was on Facebook then I would poke
Every single one of you, but it's nothing romantic
Shout out to Pacific, to Atlantic
And even the Baltic and the Mediterranean
And I am just an alien
When I'm makin' these rhymes
And I'm feelin' so fine

Let me hear it, I'm just fuckin' with it
And I know that now up on this beat

Keep on living, keep on thriving
On this mic I am surviving
Actually, maybe turn it down at here
'Cause you know I care but
If I rap too loud
I think my voice will go horse
I think my voice will go donkey
I think my voice will go mule
I was just rappin' 'bout high rule
That was the dual wear fuckin' link live that

A tiger is a big cat
But I don't give a big crap
Oh shit, he really get that

I don't hold the grudge
I just keep on droppin', I'm like Harren Judge
He is on the yankees
And I gotta say this frankly
I really miss baseball
And mix all the troubles melt away
But we don't have it on Saturdays
Or Sundays or Mondays or Wednesdays or Tues'
But we just pay our dues
Keep on rockin', keep on rappin' for our crews
Keep on doin' what we can for our friends
'Cause they're gonna be the ones in the end
To hold our hand when everything else melts away
When it all goes dark
You gotta all go back to the people from the ones that you knew at the start
I got a lot of great beats comin'
Goin' and drummin'
From my folks
Crackin' like some yokes
You know that I hope

He was the best that I ever knew
The best that I ever saw

A circular saw when I'm wearin' my Birkin stocks
Used to be that I'd work a lot
Now we work a lot tryna get our tour set up
Again 'cause you know that we got these friends
That are promoters in conserve and you owners
And even the fuckin' stage hens

No, we don't do that today
Okay, ouch, ouch, it's the shoutouts
That I gotta give to the Beatrice Teer
So everybody knows that if you wanna go
Get a shoutout, is this too on the nose?
You gotta go to watskyrelief dot com
Where you can drop those financial bombs
Pay us some owns, pays us some respects
And at the ten dollar level you get what's next
That is for meet up, say your name on the stream
[1:42:40] start
Never flippin' the bird
Never droppin' a turd
Never gettin' so scurred
That my vision is blurred
Just to keep goin
Just to keep hoping
Just to keep ropin
All of these cattle
Doing this battle
Good against evil
Never gonna leave
Never gonna be
A dude named Steve
I'm never gonna change the name
I'm gonna change the game
You think you can stop me but you can't
I'm outta control like an ant


Hour Three (2:00:00-2:59:59)
I wonder, I've got this doubt
To my girlfriend I'll shout
Amber, do you think I'm saying "fuck" too much on the stream? I'm saying "fuckin'" a lot
Did that make 'em scream?
That's cool, say it fuckin' more
Oh curl, oh curl, like Cardi B
I put glow hardly into this dark night, man, I'm saying
Fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, man, I'm sprayin'
Man, over this concrete
On this fucking dope beat
Oh shit, this is ham
Pin me in, this is the one I begin
To flow easily
This flow is so easy, see
No Eazy-E
You are all pleasing me
It's no
[2:13:08] start
Is the place that I rap
My throat sounds like I got strap
I got a limp in my step
But I don't ever dip
And I don't wear a slip
I gotta keep it up at the same clip
I woke up with a headache
But I still felt pretty relaxed
I knew in a couple hours
[2:16:00] start
Because he was pouring sweat
A whole bunch of pictures
People thought he looked really bad
Looked really sweaty
They didn't elect him
Because he had
A real bad demeanor
And betweener
All of us
That's just politucs
What do we got next?
What's a history lesson in which the people can be blessed?
Looks like a big battleship
I'm not rattled if
That's what you think
I hope you don't blink
I don't know what this is all about
A hairdresser, man, I'm callin' out
And we're the confessor
All upon my dresser
I will not pester you
And I will not tester
There's some boobies in this pic
That's cool, free the nipple, man, that's real slick
Honestly, the male nipple and the female nipple
I don't really get the difference, man, is it that simple?
Why is one obscene?
Why is one unclean?
I guess that's just what we could talk to think
That stinks
This is a dude clean, fucking clear net
I wonder who is it yet
He's in Paris
That's very romantic
They're across the Atlantic
Oh shit, this is the grassy knoll
That's the picture that I hold
That's the day JFK got popped
In its open top car he was shot
When he rolled up in Dallas
And a shooter on the hill has such malice
And he shot him and he died
That was really sad, I know my mom cried
She was in shock 'cause a little child
Man, for the whole nation that must've been wild
And there's RFK
No wait, that's wrong
You know I don't play, that's his son
RFK is here
Kennedy's son is here, man, saluting near to his father
This is the Pope
I think that's right
Gettin' harder, it's dope
Oh that's wrong, it's Irish play ride John OKC
Get all these facts right, man, you can't make me
Being wrong, that's my emo
On this mic I just spit more emo
Will I stop? I just say heck no
Yeah, here is the Pope
I guess that's just the coincidence he was on the next page, that's dope
I'm not at the end of my rope
At my rope I'm at the beginning
On the path to winning
Here's the cover about Uranus
Here's a dude swinging his kids
Around with his arms
I think that's good parenting
I think you gotta let kids do their own harm
And make their own mistakes
Man, you can't treat them a kid, glubs
That would not be great
Not at my best
But that's cool off my chest
Off my mind, can't expect to be perfect
Who just gotta keep it
Moon event, you gotta have, make it
Go, you gotta take it so slow
If you're gonna cross the finish line
If you're gonna get in time
Oh shit, it's the Fab 4
Yeah, The Beatles, that's more incredible
Than you could believe
Look at John Lennon with his crazy fuckin' sleeves
His military shirt, is that Audrey Hepburn?
I think that is, man, I'm no half stepper
What I think that was, the jacket from that campaign
You can't tell me that that's lame
So iconic
Wow, it's demonic
Harry Belafonte? That's incredible
Man, practically edible
Damn, I don't know
Woodstock, should be Hetrix
Who knows? You could blow
Wow, there's a lot of top list stuff in this book
I think that's great, man, that's not rough, look
I would show you if I wouldn't get flagged by YouTube
I'm on my sauce like shoyu, so sauce and you know that
This looks like million
A heart, I could heal one
[2:46:04] start
I have just begun
And I have not yet won
I have not yet stopped
I have not yet ceased
And I am not creased
I am not diseased
I am not leavin'
I have no bee sting on my head
I am just beasting until I'm dead
I make them see red
I have not been bled
Thank you Of all my hope
You know I just go and vote with my mind
I also vote absentee
Yeah, actually
I'm still a voter in the San Francisco 415
Prolly will be 'til the day I die
'Cause my mom is up on local politics
You know I gotta want it
You know I gotta put it straight
I got this bee in my bonnet
Me? I am not going to just stop
And drop
And stop-drop-and-roll
That’s what they teach you to do
When you’re on fire to hold
I’m on fire, I’m old
I break the fuckin’ mold
I only spit gold
I only spit cold

That is going to make me stay awake
Man, I try
To go to sleep but this

From the T to the green, man, I'm in
And everywhere in between
I barely hit the fair way
But I can parlay what I need to
'Cause it's not related
When I rack these beats I'm see-through
And my intentions
Did I mention? That were trying to go
For so god... long
That we'll sing a song
That cannot be wrong
I'm here just to rock
But I cannot talk
I cannot stop

Remember when Mandy Moore did her version on that song?

I'm alluring
I am luring a fish straight of its mooring
You wish that you were on the dock
But I clock all of your protests
But I am not going to go test you
Everything I do is not grotesque
You take a mis-cue, cause you know that I miss you
Silicon Valley is where my alley is
San Francisco, but like the tech biz
What the heck is this, all this shiz?
All the companies, non-profitable
But is there really a fucking future here?
I don't man, it's not quite clear
But I'll steer clear of investing in the next best thing
'Cause my money will go out my pockets like rockets
Fly out with a quickness
My fitness is wild
Man, check out my style, my smile
Oh my God -- his dimples -- it's great!
It's the best person ever
Do I sound like Donald Trump yet? Wait
An eternity to pass before you're burning me
This whole class that I know is fucking your degree
Man, don't give me the third degree
My buttocks are so curve-ery, you could not carve it out
Buttocks was the word they left me, so no doubt
I am nonchalant
I keep on going, I just hit the Bron
Are these words coming from the chat?
Wow, that's so cool, crap

I no flex, it's a surprise coming up blind to your eyes
Shout out to Cool Guys
Shout out to the dual I have arranged with you
In the next morning, meet with your whole crew
10 paces, then turn, then burn our eyes

The space time continuum
It’s like the Matrix, I'm bending over, man
I'm done
Why did I get into this duel with a random fan idk man i got know idea
I'm going ham
I'm on the doorstep of time
I feel your cold fingers on mine
Oh shit that was the grinch
Oh shit, did I flinch?
I have no wish list but to
Inch myself away from death
You know that I got no fucking stress
I'm a replica of myself
I'm just catsing for my help

Feeling like a rap star
Know when I can rap bars
As I fucking rep hard
Rep hard for the Bay
For the city I gotta save
It's the 415

But I love LA it's been my city for 10 years
I just know where my roots grow
Shout out to Juno
And the planet Pluto
And my boy Budo

I don't have much of a beard
This much is quite clear
But I got a couple hairs on my chin
And that's all I really need to win
And I got this little funky soul patch
If I cut it off, will it grow back?
Yeah, probably, but not more
I think I got more on my cheeks
I've grown them for weeks but its uneven
I've got more on one side, it reeks
It sucks more on my left
It’s uneven hair, man, I’m distressed
But that’s okay
Our flaws is what makes us who we are
They’re what make me a superstar
In my own mind, Vaseline
I’m on the scene, I am a queen
Feeling erratic
Give me no static
Shout out to your granny
I wonder if your granny won a grammy
If so, could she hand me that grammy?
I fucking think so
I fucking pimp the mic and I reload
I just take a heat load
Like I am in the oven
Covered in stuffing
I'm like why didn't you put the stuffing inside?
I don't know, it's not for me to decide
They don't let me cook at Thanksgiving
They don't want my gross vegetarian givings
Maybe someone will eat one serving
But nobody wants them, man
It's hurting my soul
One time I made soup
It was dope and swole
One time I made risotto, oh no
I quintoupled the fucking recipe
But no one wanted my cooking, it was the best of me
That's sad
Anyway, we'll go to sleep now
You know I cannot fucking sleep now
I be how I be always, understand
That in these hallways of my mind
My mind is so rubbery
My girlfriend said cover me
And you can discover me
Do you know about topiary
I am so necessary
I cut it like a fancy shrub
Fucking welcome to the club
Gotta give you a clue
You know what I can do
I'm gonna burn it eternal
My cat’s name was Nermal
No, no wait that was Garfield
I'm out in a far field
My mind's feeling far-fetched
You know I have not quit yet
Now I'm feeling vapid
I'm not flowing rapid
You know I just can't hit this joint
And then spit it candid
Or spit in treaties like Candide I'm on a horse, this man-steed is so dope
That I got my voice, and I know that I got my choice
And it's stupendous
Tremendous flow, when I bend this dough
For the needs of my friends and the needs of y'all
I just get this all of my chest
My chest is throbbing like Batman and Robin
But I will not be robbing
I will not be lobbing softballs all over the plate
If I ever get to interview a politician - wait
I'm looking for a loophole
I'm just trying Get it, too swole
Scolded, scalded, man, you know
Gotta keep it simple
On a lake as I ripple
Feeling my nipple
Flowing to the tempo
Never let this end, no
I'm a real rice bloke
I will not choke
I don't do coke
Well, I did a couple times
I didn't like it
I thought I kinda had to try it
But it wasn't for me and I stopped
Two times - three times? Man, I dropped
Some acid, though, out in Venice
At the Biennale with my dentist
That was fucking cool, man
That was better than some school, man
I furrow my brow vexingly
No witches are hexxing me
I do it to the nth degree
I do it so specially
Cardiac is my speciality
You got no space balls
I could just make all
Of your dreams come true
Give you a harpoon
And a damn balloon
To pop I'm in the navigator
With an alligator
They say "See you later"
They say "Meet me later at the pie spot"
Grab some pie and some coffee
All these people get off me
It’s just me, Watsky
But you know that I'm not gonna be pulled
To your dimensions and ambitions
Did I mention that occasionally I get anxiety?
I have no real piety
I don’t know why it’s me in this body, but it is
So I try to be
An okay type of dude in my daily life
In my daily doings, and maybe I
Succeed from time to time and
Do good from rhyme to rhyme
But I am keenly aware that when you see me, you stare
'Cause you're like "He looks like some dude who might make me cum
Just by looking." Oh, are you booking me with your eyes?
Are you cucking me? Why are you doing that?
You could rap about yourself in a strange day
Maybe you do every damn day
If so, you should send me the link
And when I’m not rapping for 33 hours straight
I think I’d try to watch you
If you sneeze, I would say “Achoo”
If you fucking fall, I gotchu
I try to get you up with my trust fall
I try to fucking say “Fuck all my doubts
All the dark thoughts”
I try to danish those harlots
I’m out at a used car lot
Singing some dope harmonics
SInging some harmonies
The devil can't be harming me
I got this great fantasy
That I'm on the faculty at my old school
But the school is in high rule
I’m not quite squeamish
I’m just on the scene, shit
Munching and munching
On this flow, I just jump in
All my hair is really bunchin’
And I’m eating my luncheon
Snap back on this velcro
They all say say "Hell no"
I all say “Elmo:
But I know my elbow is really close
But you still can't bite it
That's a Russian proverb
You know I won't hide it
I won't hide it on my timeline
You know that I'm fine
I'm not dying on the vine
But I need to remind you
To rewind this like the time lapse
I might collapse
I might collate myself into notes
And then go late into that deep dark night
But not gently, man, I won't go
They meant me to go so fiercely
You know you can't pierce me
With your arrows and your slings
You know you can't bring me down
When you see this crown, I will not be drowned
Do it all for pocket change
Do it all and remain
I see some words from the chat
Thank you, man, I heard that
I think I'll get - woah, these are lots of words --
Maybe not, you know that you make me hot
Under the collar, holler for a dollar
Was that Honey Boo Boo? I don't know
You do the math
Who do you think you are?
I came so far
Words from the chat: cucumber
Up my butt, that makes me not slumber
Rip me in half, that would make me laugh
I am not better than John Cena
I no go bigger -- Cena, Mena
Pause, makes me pause, I can’t get ya
I am the supreme, dream team
You know that I mean on the scene
Play a small violin, hell no
I play a small cello
I just grate this cheese
But that was unsubstantiated
I don't know if I did or not
Shout out to Itero Shout out ot Jonah Hill
I'm like "Yo it's real"
I won't ostracize anyone with weird eyes
Fucking Asian [?] orange, what rhymes with orange?
You know what rhymes with orange? George
Kind of, it's a slant rhyme
But I gotta dance, I'm happy
What’s hydrophobic? Afraid of water?
You know you go quick into dissing me
Are you saying that water on my lips has been missing me?
Sticking me in the back with these kind of sideways disses
I don't know, man
Water gets kisses from my lips
I'll fucking kiss this straw, and I get this raw
When I get this H2O, me and my duo - partner
Start your car, but you know I'm not a starter
I am not harder than whatever's inside your Larter
You got some hard tack, our crack at this is you know
Rio with the hard pack Fucking Mazel Tov
I could knock your nozzle off
Like matzo ball soup
I'm just saying "Whoop whoop!"
Shout out to Deadpool
I think it really rules
I'm ridonkuous
I drive a Tonka truck
In an increment, it's like sink or swim
I am not a fisherman
But then I just begin
I'm really wildin' all over the place
I need a Tylenol
This is drastic
What the fuck is endoplasmic?
Oof, gotta boof my strawberry smoothie
Up my damn coof
I don't know -- for a booboo hole
What could be that rhymes with coof
Stick in the opposite of my body’s roof
That was rude
Oh shit, man, damnnit
He just wove a damn vocal tapestry
Just clappin' the mic
And do it so laughably
You know I stay on ya
My words in layers like some lasagna
I'm no Flanagan
Irishman doing damn shenanigans
Actually, man, I'm like quarter Irish
On my mom's side, but I just get Eilish
Billie Eilish on the mic, really stylish
Man, I'm batting my eyelids
I play the etude, no attitude
And then I play the prelude
Out of order, I make my own rules
Got a camcorder, it's so cool
I play that mandala
But you know I swallow all of my pride
Popeye is all in my eye
In my grill, eating his goddamn spinach
Why you like that shit so much man, what is this?
I am hella bae
Hella bae'd out, as clear as cellophane
What the hell remains after that shit out on Anza Aguirre, a whole damn bonanza
Hear me, I live out on Cabrillo I scrub like a brillo pad
It's the texture of my hair
And my next flow is recipe
Y'all really got the best of me
All the quality ingredients
You know that you see me slip
I’m like a bonsai tree. I grow so slow
That I’m on my back, I barely move
When I flow, I am like a kind of lizard
Maybe, I don’t know, which kind -
A baby fucking kimodo?
Do they go slow or do they go real fast?
Ask someone else, I don’t know, I fucking pass
I’m so fucking pure
All my references are so fucking obscure
They're like, "Damn, you suck more than a fucking vacuum"
That's not true, I fucking thank you
For reminding me that time is now
To do what I do, I'm quite down
You, though, are out there like Pluto
I don't take caloric readings into account
But I am just prehistoric, on some mesozoic era shit
I am very Land Before Time, man, it’s very quipped
Well equipped, like Littlefoot or Petrie
Man I will not razzle you, I'm not dazzled
I don't embezzle funds from these funds, I won't take a dollar
Not a red cent, I won't holler
Man, fuck this breeze comin' through on my knees
I'm Chuck E. Cheese
I got this piranha flow, I got the jump off. man
So Geronimo!
Man, I'm on the way down
But they can't take my crown
With these verbal ballistics, I need these statistics
The elephant in the squad
Is not relevant, man, that's odd
I just rhyme frequently
And I do it with indecency
But I got respect from all where my peers intersect
But I connect with yo on my goddamn Rolodex
Not in my Rolls Royce
I have just got no choice
I'm a cuck
That's not true, try my luck
That's the first thing that I said when the cuck card popped up
I don't watch my girlfriend fuck others
That would be kind of strange for our relationship, ayeee
Don't wanna play that way
It's okay if you do, but that not my thang thang
I brang brang rhymes and I try to sang sang
Get some more protein, you know that I mean
What I seen, I am not a dinkle leaf Little type of periwinkle
That was a very poorly constructed rhyme
But you know, fuck, I can find sometimes
I'm behind my mind in my mouth ways
You know I go gray I just get all in, I am just fallin'
Sometimes I say "Fuck it,"
I got a little whack nugget of rhymes
And then I put it to the side
And then I just rewind my mind
And get these rhymes so hectic
When the morning becomes eclectic
Shout out to KCRW
Support your local stations, it won't trouble you
Getting so mega
Buying a ham, bacon, cheese at a bodega
I just gotta say I don't know how to play
The next word in the pile
It really makes me spile
But repugnant is not an easy word to rhyme
So I put it at the top of the rhyme and I'm fine
And I'll need some caffeine in a couple hours
When I'm on the damn scene, but for now
I'm fucking good as hell
Unscrewing my mind, man, you can tell
That is coming off like a relief cap that I just had to doff
I hope you don't scoff if I just seem soft
I feel animated, I feel that I made it -- oh shit!
What we got now? Kush Mody, throwing it down
Can I get just a bit more volume?
I am just callin' em
It feels good to fucking flow the Mody beat
Maybe a little more even? Just a fucking smiggen
I am not a stool pigeon -- that's awesome
Shout out to the DJ, replay
Everything you said, man, I'll relay
All inside of my head
Minding my own business until I am fucking dead
Man, remember Kush Mody, out in Boston
We got lost in the sauce and we did it
Man, we knew each other so long
I can’t even believe that we been so strong
And with Jackson out in the winter
We were like Master Splinter
You remember, we were doing it
We were making that music shit
I'm so proud and glad at how far we've come
And how far we had to run
I'm flipping like an acrobat on the beat
Can you fucking handle that? I will repeat this
It's about connectivity
This is nativity
It's like the young Christ giving me strength
I don't think twice, I just go back
I'm a player, but I don't crush a lot
I just wanna hit the beat a lot
I fucking got to repeat you, I'm useful
But you know that I am full
I'm not just reactive
I'm radioactive
But I am that kid
And I take it back quick
The next word is adultery
Fucking plucked like upholstery 
The beat keeps on thumpin'
Kush mody on the beat keep on bumpin'
The hour gettin' ungodly
Will I keep on going
Probably
I don't wanna create a fiasco
Just because of my wack flow
I wanna keep on goin'
I wanna keep on rowin'
11:02:50
Shoutout to Kudy Hodge
He does his duty
He’s a god
On the mic
Like supposedly
You know that yo it’s me
I got it in the pocket
I gotta fuckin’ lock it
Down
When I get downtown
No matter what they’re tellin’ me
It’s all about utility
And whatever they be sellin’ me
Shoutout to Bellamy
Yeah mister Bill Bellamy
I’m trying to make the vibe intimate
I’ll be back in a little bit
But I never stop hittin’ it
I’m just trying to pick a bit
This is my distribution
I’m just trying to hit this bullshit
Feelin’ fucking mystical
Like I said
I will hit the wall
I might need a thermometer
If you just have to monitor
How hot my flows are heating up
I’ve got to fucking tell you
I am speeding up
But that shit is not something i can maintain
Because my brain if fucking mush
Records I won’t falsify
I am just calling my
Shots
Everything good in the jood
Great
I just keep on flowing and relate
Shoutout to octopussy
The move movie you can’t push me
It was 007
He was going up to heaven
But that to damn nation
Imm now at my station
Rapping
Me ego
Is to keep flow-
Ing til we go
Go into that cold cold night
Shoutout to Snow White
That was cool
And renknowned
The flow is everlasting
I am always blasting
The beat on the stereo
Oh shit
Watsky
Look man
Here we go
He's rocking the mic
He's not stopping to hike up his jeans
Or his shorts
Or his shirt
He doesn't have time for that
Man he hurts
This mic
Is the only thing that he hurts
That he's not a fucking pacifist
Against and again I ask the mic
If he believes he is just hurt
????
Bu that was something we tried to fucking prove
But I am not a hoodlum
I keep dropping these good
Um
Flows
Some get stuck in my esophagus
Thats where its just stoppin’ it
Feelin’ good tho
A few hours ago
It felt like I might not flow
Like my throat was getting real kinda shitty
But then it got better
Why you stay with me
Feelin’ so witty
Shoutout to my dude Schmitty
And nitty gritty
The DJ
Man, he's probably not with me
But he did a couple dates on the Warped Tour

Body
Shoutout to the beatpork

We were great
Shoutout to my girl kflay
She's got a verbal aka-47 thousand
Deep inside her chest
She's reknowned
She's great
She's hounding
She's got that rhyme caviar
I say daddy are
You
Willing to take top billing
To fucking build me up and sign cor ranfycking building
Because I am not a homeowner
And that is not great
But don't all our states change with the COVID
Man some people having no kids
Because this changed our whole worlds
No little boys or girls
And maybe wait a bit
Or don't
I don't know
That's your life
Do whatever you want with your time
Because our lives are so bountiful
And we gotta just power through
Live and thank ourselves and our lucky stars
Or wonder where the fuck we are
In the universe
This is so true it hurts
But I'm not a salesman
I'm more a drink and an ale man
Bringing the truth like a mailman
Feeling like a maniac
Flowing like a brainiac
Because you know that the way I rap
Is so goddamn loquacious
That I'm saying it's gracious
When I'm on the mic I say shit
But otherwise I might not like to say
But I can’t just put this damn mic away
I'm in my cubby hole
Hiding out
'Cause you know that my buddy's roll
It's a scout
If the teacher is coming
Playin' hide-go-seek and you know that I'm drummin'
On a melody
Tell me
Fucking Makaveli
Do you smell me
You know I get heli-
Coptered out of my own mind
The doctor proctored my test
But you need not remind me
That this life is cyclical
I’m putty in god’s hands man
My buddy
It's fucking paramount
To get a golden parachute
This life is rare amount of time
But you know that we get the shoot
We're gonna lose and dilute
And leave a weird residue
I don't know
Who are you
All of these night critters
Are giving me real jitters
In the morning I won't eat fritters
I'll probably eat more smoothie
I wonder how much more there is
A lot
It doesn't have much fizz
Although at some point I have to drink the redbull-y
And then you will have to pull me
Up
On my ass from the couch
And I don't know if I doubt
Myself
I just drop these lyrical thesis
Theoretical theses
You know I make theses
Flows
I got no place-
Bo
Boop
And it doesn't make me mad
Shout out to Adam, that's the supper of dead
I'm gettin' all in
Shout out to Ben from [?]
